#### **Reflection on Challenges and Improvements:**
markdown
Challenges Faced:
1. Node.js Compatibility: Encountered issues with Node.js version incompatibility. Resolved by downgrading to Node.js 18.x.
2. API Limitations: JSONPlaceholder does not persist data. This required simulating successful responses in the UI.
3. Error Handling: Ensuring meaningful error messages were displayed when API calls failed.

## Potential Improvements:
1. Implement authentication to secure user data.
2. Add pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.
3. Improve UI/UX with additional features like search and filter functionality.
4. Write more extensive unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
5. Optimize performance by leveraging React Query for API data fetching.
